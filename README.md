# GIS-Bio-Waste-Assessment-and-Suitability-Analysis-for-Biogas-Power-Plant
site suitability analysis of biogas digester plant for municipal waste using GIS based modeling with multi criteria analysis

Critical analytical methods in situating bioenergy plants for bioenergy production are advantageous from environmental, economic, and sustainable perspectives. A study, therefore, was undertaken to provide relevant data on biogas renewable energy source using Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka premises as a case study.

The study was carried out using the power of Geographical Information System (GIS) technology.    To locate suitable sites, three sets of factors, environmental, social, and economic were considered in an analysis using 4 criteria. The criteria were settlement or residence distance, water distance, major road distance, local road distance, slope, present land use, and vegetation cover. Each criterion was evaluated using a pairwise comparison matrix with the most recent literature and our community surveys.
  
The criteria were reclassified in different levels accordingly (most suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, less suitable, and not suitable) using spatial analysis in the ArcGISÂ® environment. The reclassified features were further analyzed using a weighted linear overlay and analytic hierarchy process. This analysis indicated that the 2 most suitable sites could be used for a biogas digester plant in the study area which was presented through a web map and dashboard with ArcGIS online packages.
